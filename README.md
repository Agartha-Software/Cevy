## What is Cevy?

Cevy is a entity component system game engine built in C++, and aims to be the C++ alternative of Rust's Bevy !

## WARNING

As Bevy, Cevy is still in the early stages of development (even earlier than Bevy).

## Design Goals

* **Data Focused**: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm
* **Modular**: Use only what you need. Replace what you don't like
