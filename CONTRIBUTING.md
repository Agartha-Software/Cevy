## How to contribute to Cevy

Thanks for your interest in Contributing to cevy!

We welcome open-source contributions, whether to core features, documentation, or any sort of general improvements.

## Getting Started

If you'd like to contribute but don't know where to begin, take a look at our [issues](https://github.com/Agartha-software/Cevy/issues) page.

If you see an issue that seems like something you could address, please leave a comment on it stating you're trying your hand. Of course you can always change your mind later and stop. It's just more convenient to know who's working on what so we don't step on each other's feet.
Keep an eye out for the tag `#good first issue` it should indicate something you could easily take on.

## Guidelines

- most contributions should be made against the dev branch unless explicitely specified.
 
- Pull Requests that are still in development should be set to drafts.

- Pull Requests ready for review should state what platforms the contributor tested it on.

- Pull Requests should link the issue they relate to, if none exist it should first be created.

- Pull Requests ready for review should follow the style guide.

- Before starting work on an issue, even if you're not sure you'll take it to completion, please let us know by leaving a comment on the issue.

## Bug Tracking

As with any project, Cevy will face bugs. When you encounter one, please look for it in the existing (and recently closed!) issues.
If you find someone else has this problem, you can add information and discuss it in the thread.
If you don't, just create a new issue with `[BUG]` in the title.

Thanks for reading through all this, we're looking forward to seeing your contributions!
